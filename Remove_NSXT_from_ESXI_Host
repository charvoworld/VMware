Carefully read the requirements and limitations of this command:

1. Read NSX-T documentation for 'Remove a Host from NSX-T Data Center or Uninstall NSX-T Data Center Completely'.
2. Deletion of this Transport Node from the NSX-T UI or API failed, and this is the last resort.
3. If this is an ESXi host:
        a. The host must be in maintenance mode.
        b. All resources attached to NSXPGs must be moved out.
If the above conditions for ESXi hosts are not met, the command WILL fail.
4. If this is a Linux host:
        a. If KVM is managing VM tenants then shut them down before running this command.
        b. This command should be run from the host console and may fail if run from an SSH client
           or any other network based shell client.
        c. The 'nsxcli -c del nsx' form of this command is not supported
5. For command progress check /scratch/log/nsxcli.log on ESXi host or /var/log/nsxcli.log on non-ESXi host.
Are you sure you want to remove NSX-T on this host? (yes/no) yes
